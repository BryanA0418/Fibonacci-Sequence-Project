## Algorithm Description

1. create an function with one param.

![function](https://github.com/10-6-pursuit/independent-study-project-example/assets/145965056/3fb83e93-07b4-4a9b-811a-108aba6d0618)

2. We will create an array to put the first two numbers of the FS 0,1.

3.We will need to generate the remaining elements from the 3rd index because we already have the first 2 in the array.
